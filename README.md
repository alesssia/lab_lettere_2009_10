# Laboratorio di Informatica

This repository contains the material for the course *Laboratorio di Informatica* which was hold at Department of Letters and Philosophy, University of Turin, a.y. 2009/2010.
This website was rebuilt on March 2023 using the original material (the original website went offline when Alessia Visconti left the Department of Computer Science, University of Torino).

The website, which is derived from the [Carpentries workshop template](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template), Copyright Â© [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/), lives under the `gh-pages` branch.

The original Carpentries workshop template was modified in order to *a)* exclude files/pieces of code not required for this simpler website, *b)* adapt license and code of conduct, and *c)* modify style.
